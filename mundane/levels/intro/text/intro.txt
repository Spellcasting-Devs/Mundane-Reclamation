Life was peaceful, prospering and bright during the times of the Empire on Mundus. 

Since then, it's been nearly 50 years after the Great Holy War that ravaged the entire once-united Empire.
Plague, famine, mass exodus and wars have struck since then.
Decaying bodies and plants lie scattered over the naked ground,
the towns and villages are fresh with the smoke of fires and blood.
Not even the holiest of the holy places are spared from the infernal, treacherous acts of the mob.

Do they, the ones responsible for all of it,
know the gods will not spare them once they start bringing justice? 
Are they aware that no mercy will be given to them?
That they will be ultimately sent to the deepest depths of the world, the total darkness?
And yet despite all these warnings the gods sent even in their physical form, they kept on.
Thus... thou shall reclaim the Mundus, for thou have been assigned a divine task, an assignment,
a duty to cleanse Mundus from the impurity that corrupts even the incorruptible.
Thou are the last hope for not just the gods seeking to deliver justice, but for everyone too.
They are counting on thou, for thou shall restore what used to be Mundus before all of that. Fare thee well!
