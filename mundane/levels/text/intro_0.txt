Like many others, you are just a farmer living a rural life.
Race does not matter, for all they care about contribution to the community only.
You enjoy planting crops and harvesting them. Life is simple, no rush.
You go to have a nice little toast with your fellow farmers until suddenly...

Your village is raided by a group of barbarians! People flee and die.
You grab your scythe and make your stand against the treacherous invaders.
You probably have barely any combat experience, but you will do as much as you can.

Thus, it is time to be baptised by fire and embark on a great journey!
