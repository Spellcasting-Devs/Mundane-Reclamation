Like many others, you are just a farmer living a rural life.
You enjoy planting crops and harvesting them. Life is simple, no rush.
You go to have a nice little toast with your fellow farmers until suddenly...
Your village is raided by a group of barbarians! People flee and die.
You grab your scythe and make your stand against the barbarians.
It is time to be baptised by fire and embark on a great journey.
