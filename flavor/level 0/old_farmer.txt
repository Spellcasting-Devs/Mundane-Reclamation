Phew! Glad you're safe and sound...
My young one, you must leave the place.
It's too dangerous to keep living here.
Take this, you'll be thankful for it.

You take his old and reliable one-handed sword.

Farewell.

The village is set ablaze. You ran away into the woods.
It's midnight. You lie down, facing the tree branches.
