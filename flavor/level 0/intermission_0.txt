You tried to suppress your memories. Memories from long ago.
You tried your best, but you give in. You let memories come alive.
You are a broken person. Farming didn't solve everything, it seems.

You... you were a soldier in one of the Imperial legions.
In the last days of the Empire, you bravely fought and stood your ground.
Alas, the effort was fruitless, for the evil was greater than anything...
The legion was disbanded, many like you scattered to the four winds.

Fate is knocking on your door again. She wants you to come out and fix.
Regardless of your choice, you are forced to come out and fix anyway.
You remember who you used to be. You gain your experiences back.
It's been a while since you had your last fight. With a drunken one.

It's time to finish what was began, to complete a mission that never ended.
You take a deep sigh. You gather your strength back. Time to go.
You don't remember where you came from, so you take a random direction.

So begins the reclamantion of Mundus from evil...
