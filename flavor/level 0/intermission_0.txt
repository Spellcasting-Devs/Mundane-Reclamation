You tried to suppress your memories. Memories from long ago.
You tried your best, but you give in. You let memories come alive.
You are a broken person. Farming didn't solve everything, it seems.

Fate is knocking on your door again. She wants you to come out and fix.
Regardless of your choice, you are forced to come out and fix anyway.
You remember who you used to be. You gain your experiences back.

It's time to finish what was began... the annihilation of evil once more.

So begins the reclamantion of Mundus from evil...
