So, your name is... [player name].
And your race is... [player race].

Welcome to Mundus, hero. The world created by the ancient divines long, long ago.
The world with two moons. Thriving with life despite the chaos that happened long ago.
Life still goes on, albeit scarred. Beaten, but not giving up that easily.

Like many others, you are just a farmer living a calm, rural life in the idyllic landscape.
Race does not matter, for all they care about contribution to the community only.
You enjoy planting crops and harvesting them. Life is simple, no rush, no violence.

You sometimes miss the older times, when everything was beautiful, when you had a family.
Today is the festival, to celebrate successful harvest of this year.
You go to have a nice little toast with your fellows in the village until suddenly...

Your village is raided by a group of barbarians! Some flee while others are getting slaughtered.
You grab your recently sharpened scythe and make your stand against the treacherous invaders.
You have barely any combat experience, but you will do as much as you can.

Thus, it is time to be baptised by fire and embark on a great journey!
