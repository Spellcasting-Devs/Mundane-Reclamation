Life was peaceful, prospering and bright during the times of the Empire on Mundus. 
Many races, ranging from human, elven, dwarven, ...
to even beast races like Fennaks, lived in peaceful coexistence.
The city of splendor, the imperial residence, Ilse,
had nearly 200.000 people living inside the Walls of Ilse.
Diplomats from all over the Mundus came in awe of the riches of the city... 
The Empire was at its peak.

Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end.

Since then, it's been nearly 10 years after the 16 year-long Great Holy War 
that ravaged the entire once-united Empire.
Plague, famine, mass exodus and wars struck. Twenty million perished.
An apocalypse, not seen since the Battle of the Titans thousands years ago.
Decaying bodies and plants lie scattered over the naked ground,
the towns and villages are fresh with the smoke of fires and blood.
Not even the holiest of the holy places are spared from the infernal, treacherous acts of the mob.

Do they, the ones responsible for all of it,
know the gods will not spare them once they start bringing justice? 
Are they aware that no mercy will be given to them?
That they will be ultimately sent to the deepest depths of the world, the total darkness?
And yet despite all these warnings the gods sent even in their physical form, they kept on.

Thus... thou shall reclaim the Mundus, for thou have been assigned a divine task, an assignment,
a duty to cleanse Mundus from the impurity that corrupts even the incorruptible.
Thou are the last hope for not just the gods seeking to deliver justice, but for everyone too.
They are counting on thou, for thou shall restore what used to be Mundus before all of that.

Thou shall be the **Restorer of the Mundus**.
